I hold a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering and currently work as an Electronics Specialist, providing after-sales support for medical imaging systems—specifically X-ray technologies. With a strong technical background and years of hands-on experience in the medical device field, I’ve developed a deep interest in software development as both a hobby and a professional pursuit.

My passion lies in programming, especially in Python and C++, where I enjoy creating lightweight, practical applications designed to address real-world challenges. I have a foundational understanding of HTML and UI customization through legacy tools like FrontPage—skills I picked up during my early blogging years. Growing up with command-line-based systems and DOS has given me valuable insight into low-level computing, which later evolved into self-taught programming through tutorials and documentation.

I’m especially eager to expand into embedded systems development, including programming for microcontrollers, while continuing to build efficient desktop tools that simplify everyday tasks.

This GitHub space is where I share my work—hoping to connect with others who may find it helpful, build on these ideas, or even collaborate to turn small solutions into bigger opportunities.
