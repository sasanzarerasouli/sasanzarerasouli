#    it's ME
I hold a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering and work as an Electronics Specialist, focusing on after-sales service for X-ray imaging equipment. My passion for programming drives much of my professional and personal work, with a particular fondness for Python and C++. My journey with technology began early—at age 4, I was exploring a DOS-based computer, which sparked my curiosity for computing and gave me a foundational understanding of Windows commands. By 14, I was blogging and gained a basic familiarity with HTML, enough to tweak UI templates using tools like FrontPage.

Largely self-taught through online tutorials and educational resources, I’ve honed my programming skills to develop practical, problem-solving applications. My current focus is on creating tools that address immediate, real-world challenges, particularly in my field. I’m also eager to explore embedded programming for microcontrollers in the future.

On GitHub, I share my projects in the hope that others might find them useful, build upon them, or even collaborate to help me achieve my goals. I’m excited to contribute to the open-source community and learn from fellow developers. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out with ideas or feedback!
